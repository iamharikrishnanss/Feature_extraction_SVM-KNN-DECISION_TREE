Feature Extraction and Classification for Malaria Detection

This program demonstrates the process of feature extraction and classification for malaria detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and machine learning algorithms.
VGG19 model from TensorFlow's Keras library for image feature extraction. The script takes a set of PNG images from the specified directory, preprocesses them, and extracts features using the VGG19 model. 
It then stores the extracted features in a Pandas DataFrame and saves the DataFrame to an Excel file.
The program aims to demonstrate how feature extraction using pre-trained models and classification algorithms can be used for malaria detection. 
It utilizes the VGG19 model to extract meaningful features from cell images, and then applies different classifiers to classify the images as infected or uninfected.
